# Temporary solutions

>> Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program

> - Milton Friedman

You will often be tempted to make a temporary solution that doesn't pass the smell test, but makes the problem go away for now. Temporary solutions have an unfortunate way of becoming *de facto* permanent. Of course, since the "temporary solution" is *temporary*, it doesn't need to conform to standards, it doesn't need to be thoroughly documented, and since you'll remember it yourself, there's no need to set a followup date to design a proper fix.

Avoid at all reasonable—and some unreasonable—costs.
